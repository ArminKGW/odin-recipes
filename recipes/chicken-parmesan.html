  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Chicken parmesan</strong>, or chicken parmigiana (Italian: pollo alla parmigiana), is a dish that consists of breaded chicken breast covered in tomato sauce and mozzarella, parmesan, or provolone cheese. A quantity of ham or bacon is sometimes added.
  </p>
  <p>
    The dish originated in the Italian diaspora in the United States during the early 20th century. It has been speculated that the dish is based on a combination of the Italian parmigiana di melanzane, a dish using fried eggplant slices and tomato sauce, with a cotoletta, a breaded veal cutlet generally served without sauce or cheese in Italy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Chicken parmesan is included as the base of a number of different meals, including sandwiches and pies, and the meal is used as the subject of eating contests at some restaurants.

  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>chicken breast</li>
    <li>salt and black pepper</li>
    <li>eggs, the larger the better</li>
    <li>bread crumbs</li>
    <li>parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>olive oil</li>
    <li>tomato sauce</li>
    <li>mozzarella</li>
    <li>fresh basil</li>
    <li>grated provolone cheese</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 450F(230 C)</li>
    <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch.
    <li>Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or strainer; sprinkle flour over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides</li>
    <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
    <li>Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.</li>
    <li>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</li>
    <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
